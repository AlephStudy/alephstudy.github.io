        <h1>An Alternative</h1>
        <p>
            Gone are the days of paywalled study software, we plan on making a completely free, open-source study tool.
        </p>

    <div class="block">
        <h1>Our Plan</h1>
        <p>
            After months of research, we decided Aleph will be an app based tool, not a website.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is to keep the program as free as possible, since a website based solution would inevitably require some form of host service.

        <h2>How to build a Study Tool:</h2>
        <p>
            Aleph is currently going to be written in:
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>Dart with the Flutter framework</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This is so that we can export the code to multiple OS(s) and possibly to a web version in the future.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Website (what you're looking at):</h2>
        <p>This website is coded in pure HTML and CSS (and probably JavaScript in the future).</p>
